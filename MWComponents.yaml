name: EyeLink Device
signature: iodevice/eyelink
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
description: |
    Digital interface to an `EyeLink <http://www.sr-research.com>`_
    eye tracker.  Tested with the
    `EyeLink 1000 <http://www.sr-research.com/eyelink1000.html>`_ and
    `EyeLink II <http://www.sr-research.com/eyelinkII.html>`_ trackers,
    but may be compatible with additional devices.

    If the tracker is run in binocular mode, `eye_x`_, `eye_y`_, and `eye_z`_
    give the midpoint of the shortest connecting line that is orthogonal to both
    gaze vectors; otherwise, these values will be empty.  All other output
    parameters are specified and described in the `EyeLink 1000 User Manual
    <file:///Applications/Eyelink/docs/EyeLink1000_UserManual.pdf>`_.

parameters: 
  - 
    name: tracker_ip
    required: yes

  - 
    name: data_interval
    required: yes
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Data polling interval.  Should not be too short, but faster than
        tracker's sampling rate.
