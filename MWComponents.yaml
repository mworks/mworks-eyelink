    Digital interface to an `EyeLink <https://www.sr-research.com>`_
    eye tracker.  Tested with the `EyeLink 1000/1000 Plus
    <https://www.sr-research.com/products/eyelink-1000-plus/>`_
    and `EyeLink II <https://www.sr-research.com/products/eyelink-ii/>`_
    trackers, but may be compatible with additional devices.

    If the tracker is run in binocular mode, `eye_x`_, `eye_y`_, and `eye_z`_
    give the midpoint of the shortest connecting line that is orthogonal to both
    gaze vectors; otherwise, these values will be empty.  All other output
    parameters are specified and described in the EyeLink 1000 User Manual.  If
    an eye tracker packet contains no data for a parameter, EyeLink's
    ``MISSING_DATA`` value (-32768) is written to the corresponding variable.

    .. rubric:: Calibration

    In order to perform a tracker-driven calibration, validation, or drift
    correction, you must arrange for the drawing of a fixation target on MWorks'
    stimulus display at locations and times controlled by the tracker.  This is
    accomplished via the parameters `cal_target_x`_, `cal_target_y`_, and
    `cal_target_visible`_, as demonstrated in the following example::

        // cal_target_x and cal_target_y receive the location of the
        // fixation target
        
        var cal_target_x = 0
        var cal_target_y = 0
        
        circle cal_target (
            color = 1,0,0
            x_size = 1
            x_position = cal_target_x
            y_position = cal_target_y
            )
        
        // cal_target_visible receives the signal to show or hide
        // the fixation target.  Attached actions draw or remove
        // the target as appropriate.
        
        var cal_target_visible (false) {
            choose {
                when (cal_target_visible) {
                    queue_stimulus (cal_target)
                    update_display ()
                }
                otherwise {
                    clear_display ()
                }
            }
        }
        
        // All three variable names must be provided as parameters
        // in the device declaration
        
        iodevice/eyelink eyelink (
            ...
            cal_target_x = cal_target_x
            cal_target_y = cal_target_y
            cal_target_visible = cal_target_visible
            ...
            )

    To initiate a calibration, validation, or drift correction, use the
    `EyeLink Tracker Setup` action::

        eyelink_tracker_setup (
            device = eyelink
            calibration_type = HV13

name: EyeLink Tracker Setup
signature: action/eyelink_tracker_setup
isa: Action
platform: macos
description: |
    Prepare for calibration and launch the setup screen of an `EyeLink Device`.

    Before launching the setup screen, this action sets the tracker's
    gaze-position coordinate system (via EyeLink's ``screen_pixel_coords``
    command) to match the coordinate system used on MWorks' main stimulus
    display.  It then sets the calibration type (as specified in
    `calibration_type`_), so that the tracker recomputes the positions of
    fixation targets in the new coordinate system.

    Once the EyeLink setup screen has been launched, the user can manually
    initiate calibration, validation, or drift correction via the EyeLink host
    PC.

    This action can be executed only when the EyeLink device is *stopped* (i.e.
    before the experiment invokes `Start IO Device` on it, or after it invokes
    `Stop IO Device`).  Execution continues until the user manually exits the
    setup screen on the EyeLink host PC.
